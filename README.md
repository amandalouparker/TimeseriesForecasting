# TimeseriesForecasting

This repo demonstrates the use of ARIMA model time series forcasting on both UFO sighting data and stock prices. 
The repo contains ipython notebooks that go the whole hog, including time series decomopotision as well as brute force ARIMA model testing to determine the best paramaters for the best fitting time forcasting model. There is also a 'quick' 3 month timseries script that bypasses the grid search (brute force) methods and outputs suggestions on whether to buy, sell or hold stock based on the past trajectory of the data
