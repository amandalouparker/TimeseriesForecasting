# TimeseriesForecasting

This repo demonstrates the use of ARIMA model time series forcasting on both FO sighting data and stock prices. 
The repo contains ipython notebooks that go the whole hog, including time series decomotision as well as brute force ARIMA model testing to determine the best paramaters for a good fitting time forcasting model. There is also a 'quick' 3 month timseries script that bypasses the grid search (brute force) to output whether or not to buy, sell or hold stock based on the past trajectory of the data
